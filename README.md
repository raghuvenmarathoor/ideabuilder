# Democracy
An open source project for collecting ideas from user base. 

The present code is incomplete and it is created using yeoman and designed for openshift servers. Nothing is being done at the present stage except the code is generated using https://developers.openshift.com/en/node-js-example-meanstack.html

Plan is to create a module which could be plugged in to the existing system. There will be two types of users: users and developers. The user can give an idea, vote for an idea and contribute to existing idea. The developers can check through the ideas and make it into their discussion to improve the product. The idea must have a few states

1 created
2 under consideration
3 under discussion
4 accepted
5 building
6 implemented
or 
rejected

Create notifications for users incase the idea is accepted. The developer can comment on their status. I believe that this can be common requirement for most of the businesses. This will give the user an idea about the ideas of other users and it will definitely help the developer to get a clear idea about 'what the users expect from their system'.
